This project contains ideas for projects that can be completed during a one-day hackathon.
The projects are roughly divided to projects that enable people to practice P4 and projects that contribute to the P4 community, and are not necessarily written in P4.

***

**Title:** Multi-target applications

**Description:** One of the limitations of existing P4 code is that different architectures require different code. The goal of this project will be to take some existing P4 applications, written for a given architecture, and port it to other architectures. Recommended architectures include v1model, PSA and SimpleSumeSwitch, but all open-source architectures can be used. The code can then be used for educational purposes.

**Type (P4 Practice / Community Contribution):** Mainly P4 practice, but for a community contribution.

**Title:** P4Fun

**Description:** Implement a classic game in P4. Examples include tic-tac-toe, Battleship, and others.

**Type (P4 Practice / Community Contribution):** P4 practice.

**Title:** PSA bug fixes

**Description:** The architecture workgroup requests assistance in fixing some of the bugs currently documented in [its issues list](https://github.com/p4lang/p4-spec/issues). Bug fixes are especially encouraged for PSA.

**Type (P4 Practice / Community Contribution):** Community contribution

**Proposed by:** Calin Cascaval

**Title:** Improving NetCache and NetChain

**Description:** Improve the quality of the open source code of [NetCache](https://github.com/netx-repo/netcache-p4) and  [NetChain](https://github.com/netx-repo/netchain-p4).

Goal 1: Turn the code into a tutorial / programming assignment.

Goal 2: Add and improve documentation.

**Type (P4 Practice / Community Contribution):** Both!

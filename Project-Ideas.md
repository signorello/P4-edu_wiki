**Title:** Code Test Infrastructure

**Description:** Code rot is always an issue in maintained environments. With the P4 language and tools continuously evolving, we are seeking to build code test infrastructure that will allow to maintain the P4 reference environment, with a focus on materials curated by the education workgroup, over time. 

**Expected Outcome:** Continuous test infrastructure for tutorial code.

**Skills (Required / Preferred):** Travis CI, Docker, P4, Python

**Possible Mentors:** Robert Soulé -- USI

**Title:** Extend the P4 to eBPF compiler back-end

**Description:** The P4 programming language has emerged as a programming language for network dataplanes. The eBPF language is a safe virtual machine language that can execute safely within the linux kernel. The existing P4 to eBPF compiler does not support many important P4 language features. This project would extend the capabilities of this back-end.

**Expected Outcome:** Support for more P4 language constructs.

**Skills (Required / Preferred):**  C++11, basic networking knowledge, ideally some knowledge of compiler technologies

**Title:** Code Test Infrastructure

**Description:** Code rot is always an issue in maintained environments. With the P4 language and tools continuously evolving, we are seeking to build code test infrastructure that will allow to maintain the P4 reference environment, with a focus on materials curated by the education workgroup, over time. 

**Expected Outcome:** Continuous test infrastructure for tutorial code.

**Skills (Required / Preferred):** Travis CI, Docker, P4, Python

**Possible Mentors:** Robert Soulé -- USI

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Title:** Extend the P4 to eBPF compiler back-end

**Description:** The P4 programming language has emerged as a programming language for network dataplanes. The eBPF language is a safe virtual machine language that can execute safely within the linux kernel. The existing P4 to eBPF compiler does not support many important P4 language features. This project would extend the capabilities of this back-end.

**Expected Outcome:** Support for more P4 language constructs.

**Skills (Required / Preferred):**  C++11, basic networking knowledge, ideally some knowledge of compiler technologies

**Possible Mentors:**  Mihai Budiu – VMware Research

**Title:** PSA architecture implementation

**Description:** Implement the PSA specification in the p4c compiler and the BMv2 simulator. The goal of the project is to have a working implementation of PSA v1.1. The project is organized around tasks that touch both the compiler and the simulator -- there needs to be a definition and implementation of the PSA externs in BMv2 and the corresponding code generated by the compiler. There are several examples of such implementations for other architectures (e.g., v1model).

**Expected Outcome:** A functional PSA v1.1 implementation

**Skills (Required / Preferred):**
        Required: 3+ years of C++ coding.
	Preferred: Compiler architecture understanding, IR transformations and traversals. Computer networking understanding.

**Possible Mentors:**  Antonin Bas, Han Wang.

**Difficulty:** Completing the entire project is Medium, there are a number of sub-projects that are easy.

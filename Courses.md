### High Performance Networking (P51)
**University:** University of Cambridge

**Aims of the course:** A practical course providing an introduction to high-performance network devices. Covers aspects of realistic switch design, understanding network-device architecture and performance. Students are assessed based on a practical assignment: the design of a high-performance network device. 

**Target audience and prerequisites:** Graduate students (Masters and PhD level), also taken not-for-credit by postdocs. Prerequisites include an undergraduate course in networking, good working knowledge of C/C++, ECAD, Unix.

**Length of the course:** 6 lecture hours, 10 (5x2) lab hours. Students are expected to do their project outside lab hours.

**Relation to P4:** Practical work (i.e. project) using P4-NetFPGA.

**Available material:** All the course's materials are available [On the course's website].(http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/P51/materials.html)

**Status:** In 2017/18 the course was delivered using NetFPGA (not P4-NetFPGA), as the platform (PTA) wasn't ready.
Lab 1-2 require rewriting, may also add another programmable devices lectures, instead of (e.g.,) latency.

**Wishful thinking:** Creating an online P4-NetFPGA tutorial that compiles programs, like the NetFPGA verilog tutorial.

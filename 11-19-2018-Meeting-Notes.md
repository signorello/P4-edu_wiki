Meeting Notes
======

Ran a session of introductions. Some of the relevant information shared:
* Arturo (Spain) - Interest ONOS and P4. Ran some tutorials.
* Andreas Kassler (Sweden)- Designing an advanced computer networks course, using Netronome cards.
* Sandor Laki (Hungary) - working on a P4 compiler (T4P4S), delivered P4 tutorial at HPSR'18 and at the university. 
* Andy Fingerhut (Cisco, USA) - educational activities within Cisco and customer facing, maintains a p4 getting starting page
* Eder (Denmark) - PhD student, interested due to future teaching needs within his institute
* Kursat Gol (Nokia, Turkey) - Interested in SDN and NFV
* Stephen Ibanez (USA) - Ran the previous CS344 course and Stanford and working toward its next instance
* Elisa Rojas (Spain) - SDN and DC networks. Getting started with P4.
* Levente (Hungary) - Made recent contributions to the p4 repository
* Srivani - previously at Cisco, volunteered to help with various efforts.
* Yipeng (Intel, USA)

Noa and Robert introduced the P4 Education workgroup charter.

The was a short discussion of existing tutorial experience. Yipeng suggested creating more p4 runtime material may be useful.

We surveyed existing and upcoming P4-related academic courses. Stephen described the CS344 course running at Stanford. He indicated that for next year he intends to add support to run the same code on mininet and in the hardware. Also integrating bmv2 and ns3. Robert intends to run at Lugano a version of CS344 but using Tofino. Andreas is working on 120 hours course that will cover an introduction to p4 (partly reusing tutorial materials), and two advanced modules: Load balancing, and Telemetry and caching. Part of the course will be using videos, that will be uploaded to youtube.   

We discussed additional educational materials, e.g., getting started guide. 
Question to the group: What else is needed?

* The equivalent of P4's "Hello World"
* 10-15min tutorial videos
* A way to maintain versions and avoid code-rot (in the context of tutorials)

The workgroup has a goal to widen participation. No specific action items or ideas came up during the meeting.

Looking at Future events, there was a consensus that events should target communities beyond the immediate networking / SIGCOMM community:

* Stephen is running a P4-NetFPGA tutorial at FPGA'19.
* There was a suggestion to run an event with NSDI. Possibly a BoF?
* Network operators and network engineering may be the right community to engage with.
* Software developers may be an additional community. Robert mentioned past interaction with ECOOP.
